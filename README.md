Setting Up GCC For Net Yaroze Development Under Linux


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COFF

COFF's main improvement over a.out was the introduction of multiple named sections in the object file. Different object files could have different numbers and types of sections. 


The COFF file header stores the date and time that the object file was created as a 32-bit binary integer, representing the number of seconds since the Unix epoch, 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC. Dates occurring after 19 January 2038 cannot be stored in this format, resulting in an instance of the year 2038 problem.
